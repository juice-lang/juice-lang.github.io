# Introduction

**Welcome to the *juice* programming language documentation.**  
This documentation doesn’t aim to be 100% complete, because the implementation of the language didn’t even began, so it’s hard to know all difficulties, which this definition might bring into coding. Nonetheless it serves as a guide for developing *juice* and also gives a first impression of the language.
